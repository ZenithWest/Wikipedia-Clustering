Git History

In VS right click solution -> Git History

You might want to have Git History open in background so you can see the changes you make while performing the steps above.

The only three branches you need to worry about:

[remote/origin/master]
Main files that everyone will push goes here. You should [Retrieve data from master branch] if you notice changes.

[remote/origin/Colby-Branch]
This is your remote branch stored on the internet.

[Colby-Branch]
This is your branch stored locally on your computer.
(You should keep your local and remote synced up and then push to master branch when your ready)
